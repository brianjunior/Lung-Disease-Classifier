## Model Architecture

- **Base Model:** The Lung Disease Classifier utilizes the DenseNet201 architecture, a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) with 201 layers. The model is initialized with weights pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset.

- **Custom Layers:** On top of the base model, custom fully connected layers are added for classification:
  - Flatten layer
  - Dropout layer (with a dropout rate of 0.5)
  - Dense layer with 512 units and ReLU activation
  - Output layer with 5 units (one for each class) and softmax activation

- **Input Shape:** Images are resized to 224x224 pixels with 3 color channels (RGB) to match the input shape expected by the model.

- **Freezing Pre-trained Layers:** During training, the layers of the pre-trained DenseNet201 model are frozen to prevent their weights from being updated.

# Model training
training = """
## Model Training

- **Data Preprocessing:** The training data is augmented using data generators to improve model generalization. Augmentation techniques include rescaling, width and height shifting, and zooming.

- **Optimization:** The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function.

- **Callbacks:** Two callbacks are employed during training:
  - ModelCheckpoint: Saves the model with the highest validation accuracy.
  - ReduceLROnPlateau: Reduces the learning rate when the validation accuracy plateaus.

- **Training Parameters:** The model is trained for {} epochs.

## Model Evaluation

- **Validation:** Model performance is evaluated on a separate validation dataset during training to monitor accuracy and loss.

- **Testing:** After training, the model is evaluated on a test dataset to assess its generalization performance.

## Results

- **Training History:** The training history is visualized with plots showing training and validation accuracy and loss over epochs.

- **Test Results:** The model's final performance on the test dataset is reported, including test loss and test accuracy.

## Usage Instructions

To use the Lung Disease Classifier model, follow these steps:

1. Load the trained model weights from "densenet201.hdf5" (the checkpoint file generated during training).
2. Preprocess input images by resizing them to 224x224 pixels and normalizing pixel values to the range [0, 1].
3. Feed the preprocessed image(s) into the model for classification.
4. The model will return class probabilities for each of the five categories. The class with the highest probability is the predicted class.
